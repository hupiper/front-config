# GitOps Cluster Configuration

This is a repo to demo setting up OpenShift Service Mesh in a ROSA cluster. I started with [Gerald Nunn's repo](https://github.com/gnunn-gitops/cluster-config) because I was familiar with it. I also used parts of the [Red Hat Community of Practice Gitops Catalog](https://github.com/redhat-cop/gitops-catalog).
